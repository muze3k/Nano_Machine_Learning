# Nano_Machine_Learning

Library for running inference on esp32 using the model trained through conventional tensorflow/keras libraries. The model is transformed into raw bytes and stored in esp32.

To-do list:
- [x] Dense matmul
- [x] ReLU
- [x] Forward Pass
- [ ] Conv2D
- [ ] Downsampling
- [ ] Multi core processing
